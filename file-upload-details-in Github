1. CoverM_Abundance_Cpm.xlsx : This file contains abundance data for 347 MAGs at different salinity and different season from two bays.

The naming is like following:

The sheet name : 
CP stands for first bay Chesapeake
Sum stands for summer
fresh water/low salinity means it is from the river which joins to the bay and salinity is too low.
Medium : from Estury, medium salinity ranging from 15-22
High : the sample originates from open ocean_high salinity


Name of the sample: classified_CPBay_Sum06G08_DNA.bac.ar.fastq TPM 

                       name of bay-season(summer) salinity (06 is 0.6) G is greater than 0.8(particle attached)-----
                                                                       L stands for lessthan 0.8 micro meter(free living)....
                                                                       
      *** the original file is   coverm_360_renamed_cpm.tsv.
      
2. Metabolic_results.xlsx : this file contains the output of metabolic. this not edited/original one.

However you can find the edited one as below.

i). FunctionHit_metabolic.xlsx : contain salinity and season wise details
	
ii) HMMHitNum_jan24_mg)metabolic.xlsx
iii) KEGGModuleHit_metabolic.xlsx       

3. updtaed metadata file.

     **************************************
     
   Two other files are    KEGGModuleHit_metabolic_0-1_scoring.xlsx and  FunctionHit_metabolic_0-1 scoring.xlsx, here the metabolic output just turned to a scoring, 0 corresponds for absent and 1 for presence.
